How to use:
Open the tool whenever you like but DO NOT activate it until you spawn into a zombies game.
Disable and close the tool before leaving the zombies game.

Prestige Master Lobby:
Set XP modifier and enable it, the person wanting the level needs to stand and do nothing.
The other person(s) in the lobby kill all the zombies for 10 rounds, then on round 11 turn off godmode etc and let everyone die for the level to stick.

Max Weapons Lobby:
Set Weapon XP modifier then TP zombies to crosshair and enable the cycle weapons, pause the cycle in between rounds. If any guns are missed give them seperately.

Camo Lobby:
Godmode etc, TP zombies to crosshair and enable insta kill for easy camos, use weapon cycle if going for Dark Aether.

I hope to add instant dark aether eventually.
